# A Cool Text Editor to Use for Compiler project

This project is A cool Text Editor made using JavaFx Tool to Allow the user to <br>
create a file ,<br>
edit the file , <br>
store the file and compile it <br>
, it also allows to show the language of compilation .

JavaFx was used for its efficiency and it offers a good way to handle the business logic of the app using controllers and also the layout of the app using css files 
<br> We used a mediator with singleton pattern to establish a centralized communication witin the whole app!!

## A Demo of the Application:
